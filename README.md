# Dashboard SLA

## Progress

First, **I converted the application from vue2 to vue3.** To do this, I updated/removed/added dependencies in *package.json* and changed some of the base code in main.js.

## Decisions



## Local Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
